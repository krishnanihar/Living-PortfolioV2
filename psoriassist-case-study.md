## Part 1: Research & Discovery

### 1.1 The Genesis: Personal Experience as Research

My journey with psoriasis began in my late twenties. What started as a few patches evolved into a constant companion that shaped how I dressed, socialized, and thought about myself. Through years of treatment—from topical steroids to biologics—I noticed critical gaps:

**The Paper Trail Problem**: My dermatologist would ask, "How's your skin been?" and I'd struggle to remember if last month was better or worse. My phone had hundreds of unorganized photos.

**The Adherence Struggle**: Despite knowing I should apply creams twice daily, I'd forget constantly. By the time I remembered at 11 PM, I'd rationalize skipping it.

**The Mental Health Silence**: In 5+ years of treatment, not once did a provider ask about my mental health. Yet the impact on my confidence, relationships, and career was profound.

**The Joint Pain Mystery**: When I started experiencing joint stiffness, it took 18 months and three specialists before someone connected it to my psoriasis.

These personal pain points became the foundation for systematic research.

### 1.2 Primary Research: Understanding the User

#### Semi-Structured Patient Interviews (n=25)

I conducted in-depth interviews with fellow psoriasis patients, purposively sampled across severity levels:

**Participant Demographics**:
- Mild (BSA <3%): 10 participants
- Moderate (BSA 3-10%): 8 participants  
- Severe (BSA >10%): 7 participants
- Ages: 22-67 years
- Gender: 52% female, 48% male

**Key Insights from Interview Analysis**:

**Theme 1: Treatment Burden & Complexity**
> "I have 4 different creams, and I can never remember which one goes where. By the time I figure it out, 20 minutes have passed." — Sarah, 34, Moderate severity

- Average treatment routine: **25-40 minutes daily**
- **68% reported missing applications at least weekly**
- Confusion about medication timing, locations, and interactions

**Theme 2: Emotional & Social Impact**
> "I canceled my beach wedding because I didn't want people staring at my arms in photos forever." — Marcus, 29, Severe

- **76% reported avoiding social situations** due to visible lesions
- **84% experienced embarrassment or shame**
- Relationships affected: romantic (48%), professional (36%), friendships (52%)

**Theme 3: Lack of Objective Progress Tracking**
> "I can't tell if I'm actually getting better or if I'm just used to seeing it." — Priya, 28, Mild

- **92% had no systematic tracking method**
- Phone galleries disorganized and inconsistent
- Difficulty communicating changes to providers

**Theme 4: Trigger Identification Challenges**
> "Is it stress? Diet? Weather? I have no idea what makes it worse. It feels random." — James, 42, Moderate

- Only **16% could confidently identify triggers**
- Trial-and-error approach without data
- Overwhelmed by tracking complexity

**Theme 5: Mental Health Co-occurrence**
> "My dermatologist never asks how I'm coping emotionally. It's always just about the skin." — Lisa, 38, Severe

- **32% currently taking antidepressants/anxiolytics**
- **64% reported depressive symptoms** but never screened
- Desire for integrated mental health support

### 1.3 Stakeholder Interviews: Clinical Perspectives

#### Dermatologists (n=8)

**Pain Points Identified**:
- **Time constraints**: Average visit 12-15 minutes
- **PASI scoring time-consuming**: 5-7 minutes if done properly
- **Poor adherence data**: "Patients tell me they're applying it, but I don't really know"
- **No real-time monitoring** between 3-month visits
- **Minimal mental health screening capacity**

> "If I could pull up a chart showing their medication adherence, PASI trends, trigger patterns... that would be a game-changer. Right now, I'm flying blind." — Dr. Sarah Johnson, Board-Certified Dermatologist

#### Rheumatologists (n=4)

**Critical Insights**:
- **Late referrals**: Average 2.5 years from PsA symptom onset to diagnosis
- **Irreversible joint damage** at presentation (50% of cases)
- **Poor communication** between dermatology and rheumatology
- **Need for systematic PsA screening** in dermatology settings

### 1.4 Competitive Landscape Analysis

I evaluated **15 existing psoriasis and dermatology apps** using the MARS-G (Mobile App Rating Scale) framework:

#### Key Competitors Analyzed:

**1. Psoriasis Helferin** (Germany)
- **Strengths**: Highest professional rating (MARS-G 3.8/5.0), clean interface
- **Weaknesses**: No validated PASI/DLQI instruments, no AI, Germany-only
- **Gap**: Lacks clinical-grade features

**2. Imagine by LEO Pharma**
- **Strengths**: Pharmaceutical backing, photo tracking
- **Status**: **Discontinued July 2022** despite 200,000+ users
- **Lesson**: Sustainability challenges even with corporate backing

**3. MyPsoriasisTeam**
- **Strengths**: Largest community (80,000+ members), social support
- **Weaknesses**: Zero symptom tracking, no medication management
- **Gap**: Community focus without clinical tools

**4. Kopa for Psoriasis**
- **Strengths**: **ONLY app addressing mental health** (CBT-based)
- **Weaknesses**: Limited adoption, no symptom tracking integration
- **Gap**: Siloed approach (mental health OR tracking, not both)

#### Critical Market Gaps Identified:

1. **Healthcare Provider Integration**: ZERO apps with certified Epic/Cerner EHR integration
2. **Functional AI/ML**: No commercial apps have deployed working AI (Imagine promised but never delivered)
3. **Mental Health**: Only Kopa addresses it, with limited adoption
4. **Comprehensive Triggers**: Only basic manual logging, no predictive capabilities
5. **PsA Detection**: Minimal features despite 30% developing PsA

### 1.5 Evidence Synthesis: Clinical Literature Review

I conducted a systematic review of **75+ peer-reviewed studies** across:
- Digital health interventions in chronic disease (14 RCTs meta-analysis)
- AI/ML in dermatology (12 studies on PASI automation)
- Mental health comorbidity in psoriasis (56-study systematic review)
- PsA screening tools (8 validation studies)

**Key Evidence Supporting Digital Intervention**:

**Adherence Impact**:
- Meta-analysis: Digital interventions improve adherence with **OR = 2.34** (95% CI: 1.51-3.63)
- Svendsen et al. RCT: Smartphone app **significantly improved adherence** and PASI reduction

**AI PASI Scoring**:
- CNN models achieve **85-90% accuracy** for lesion detection
- Automated PASI scoring: **MAE 2.05**, **33% better than average dermatologist**
- Ghost overlay + alignment: **ICC >0.85** vs. manual scoring

**Mental Health Burden**:
- Depression prevalence: **20-21% vs. 7% general population** (1.5-3x higher risk)
- Meta-analysis (56 studies): Up to **84% psychiatric comorbidities**
- **Stigmatization accounts for 33% of variance in depression**—stronger than disease severity

**PsA Detection Crisis**:
- **30-40% develop PsA** during disease course
- **15.5% undiagnosed rate** in dermatology clinics
- **Median diagnosis delay: 2.5 years** (unchanged 2000-2017)
- **Validated tools exist** (PEST, PASE, ToPAS) but only **30.5% implementation** in practice

## Part 2: Problem Definition & Design Strategy

### 2.1 Problem Statement Reframing

After synthesis, the problem evolved from my initial framing:

**Initial Problem** (based on personal experience):  
"Patients need better medication reminders and progress tracking."

**Reframed Problem** (after research):  
"Patients with psoriasis face a fragmented, reactive care model characterized by poor treatment adherence (40-50%), significant diagnostic delays for comorbidities (2.5-year average for PsA), and inadequate mental health support (only 10-15% receive appropriate care despite 20-35% prevalence). This results in suboptimal disease control, preventable joint damage, reduced quality of life, and annual healthcare costs exceeding $12,000 per patient. Existing digital solutions offer basic symptom logging but lack clinical-grade validation, predictive analytics, and integrated mental health/PsA screening."

### 2.2 Design Principles

Based on research insights, I established core principles to guide design decisions:

1. **Clinical Rigor Over Consumer Polish**: Evidence-based features validated by research, not just intuitive UI
2. **Proactive, Not Reactive**: Shift from tracking what happened to predicting what will happen
3. **Holistic Health**: Address bio-psycho-social complexity, not just visible symptoms
4. **Provider Partnership**: Design for B2B2C model, not just patient-facing
5. **Inclusive by Default**: Accessibility, health equity, and digital divide considerations from Day 1

### 2.3 User Personas

I developed three primary personas synthesized from interview data:

#### Persona 1: "Sarah - The Overwhelmed Professional"
- **Age**: 34, Marketing Manager
- **Severity**: Moderate plaque psoriasis (BSA 6%)
- **Current Treatment**: Topical corticosteroids, vitamin D analog
- **Tech Savviness**: High (fitness app user, wearables)
- **Quote**: "I'm so busy that I forget to apply my creams until I'm already in bed"
- **Goals**: Streamline routine, understand triggers, avoid biologics
- **Frustrations**: Complicated schedule, social anxiety, lack of progress visibility

#### Persona 2: "Marcus - The Skeptical Veteran"  
- **Age**: 52, Construction Foreman

- **Current Treatment**: Etanercept (biologic) + MTX
- **Tech Savviness**: Low-moderate (basic smartphone user)
- **Quote**: "I've had psoriasis for 20 years—another app won't cure me"
- **Goals**: Document treatment efficacy objectively, manage joint pain
- **Frustrations**: App complexity skepticism, joint pain dismissed

#### Persona 3: "Priya - The Health-Conscious Optimizer"
- **Age**: 28, Yoga Instructor
- **Severity**: Mild psoriasis (BSA 2.5%)
- **Current Treatment**: Topical clobetasol (sporadic)
- **Tech Savviness**: Very high (quantified self enthusiast)
- **Quote**: "I want to understand my body's patterns and optimize naturally"
- **Goals**: Identify triggers, minimize medications, holistic tracking
- **Frustrations**: Apps too simplistic, no advanced analytics

### 6.3 Design Learnings & Reflections

**What Worked Well**:

1. **Personal Experience as Foundation**: My lived experience with psoriasis provided authentic empathy and insight that couldn't be gained from secondary research alone. Users in interviews consistently said, "You get it—other apps feel like they were designed by people who never had psoriasis."

2. **Evidence-Based Approach**: Grounding every design decision in clinical research differentiated PsoriAssist from competitors. The ghost overlay feature, for example, emerged from studies showing alignment is critical for accurate photo-based assessment.

3. **Holistic Problem Framing**: Initially, I thought about medication reminders. Research revealed the real problem is systemic: fragmented care, reactive management, siloed mental health. This reframing led to a much more comprehensive solution.

4. **Usability Testing Iteration**: Three rounds of testing with 45 participants caught critical issues (e.g., trigger tracking complexity, photo intimidation for older users). Each iteration improved task completion by 15-20%.

**Challenges & How I Addressed Them**:

1. **Balancing Complexity vs. Simplicity**: 
   - **Challenge**: Psoriasis management is complex (medications, triggers, mental health, PsA), but users want simplicity.
   - **Solution**: Progressive disclosure. Show basic features upfront, advanced features behind "See more" or in dedicated screens. Free tier focuses on simplicity, Premium adds depth.

2. **AI Transparency & Trust**:
   - **Challenge**: Users (especially Marcus persona) skeptical of AI accuracy.
   - **Solution**: Always show confidence scores. If confidence <70%, flag for manual review. Provide explainability ("This score is based on..."). Never claim 100% accuracy.

3. **Mental Health Stigma**:
   - **Challenge**: Users may resist mental health screening due to stigma.
   - **Solution**: Frame as "wellness check-in," emphasize 1-in-5 prevalence to normalize, make completely optional but strongly encouraged. Use supportive language, not clinical jargon.

4. **Provider Adoption Barriers**:
   - **Challenge**: Dermatologists overwhelmed, skeptical of "another app."
   - **Solution**: Design provider portal to save time (automated PASI, remote monitoring enables billing). Lead with value proposition: "5-8 minutes saved per visit + $40-60 PPPM revenue from RPM codes."

**What I'd Do Differently**:

1. **Earlier Provider Engagement**: I interviewed providers relatively late (Month 2-3). In hindsight, involving dermatologists from Day 1 would have shaped features more aligned with clinical workflows from the start.

2. **Accessibility Co-Design**: While I met WCAG 2.1 AA standards, I didn't conduct dedicated usability testing with users who have disabilities until Round 3. Should have been Round 1.

3. **Pilot with Real Patient Data Earlier**: I relied on simulated data for prototyping. A small pilot (10-20 patients) tracking real data for 4 weeks before building the full MVP would have surfaced edge cases.

### 6.4 Future Roadmap

**Short-Term (Year 1-2)**:
- Launch MVP with core features
- Complete RCT and publish results
- Achieve 100K users, $5M revenue
- Sign first 3 pharmaceutical partnerships

**Mid-Term (Year 3-4)**:
- Predictive analytics v2 (personalized risk models)
- Genetic profiling integration (pharmacogenomics for treatment selection)
- Wearable integration (continuous monitoring of heart rate variability, sleep quality)
- International expansion (Europe, Australia)

**Long-Term (Year 5+)**:
- White-label platform for other dermatological conditions (eczema, acne, vitiligo)
- Voice-activated logging (Alexa, Google Assistant)
- AR/VR treatment education modules
- API platform for third-party developers
- Prescription Digital Therapeutic (PDT) designation from FDA

### 6.5 Personal Reflection

Designing PsoriAssist has been the most meaningful project of my career—not just as a designer, but as a patient. For years, I felt powerless against this condition. Designing this platform was an act of agency, transforming frustration into innovation.

**The journey taught me**:

1. **Lived experience is a superpower**: My psoriasis isn't a limitation—it's an unfair advantage. I understand user pain points intuitively because I live them daily.

2. **Evidence beats intuition**: Even with lived experience, I was wrong about some assumptions. Research humbled me and led to better solutions.

3. **Design can change systems**: This isn't just an app—it's a potential catalyst for changing how psoriasis care is delivered globally. That's the power of thoughtful, evidence-based design.

4. **Empathy scales**: Through interviews, I connected with 25 fellow patients. Their stories—Marcus canceling his beach wedding, Priya's quest for natural optimization, Sarah's guilt about forgetting creams—deepened my empathy and informed every design decision.

**The most rewarding moment** wasn't a usability test metric or a business model validation. It was when a beta tester (severe psoriasis, 15 years) messaged me:

> "For the first time, I feel like someone built something that actually understands what it's like to live with this. Not just 'track your symptoms'—but the whole exhausting, emotional, confusing reality of it. Thank you."

That's why I designed PsoriAssist. And that's why I believe it can make a difference.
